After sending Banano from BananoVault, you should now receive a notification on your Ledger prompting you to confirm or deny the transaction.  By default, BananoVault will receive transactions automatically.  If a transaction is pending, it can be confirmed manually by selecting "Receive" from the left sidebar, which will trigger the option to confirm manually on your Ledger device.
